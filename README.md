# Hello there and welcome to my GitHub üßê

## About Me
I'm Francisco (Chico if you prefer  ), currently graduating in Computer Science at University of S√£o Paulo's Mathematics and Statistics Institute.
I really enjoy imagining, structuring and coding systems of all kinds. Besides that, I love clever algorithms that solve real world problems.

Now focusing on learning [Vue.js](https://github.com/jooaodanieel/devboost-frontend) and [Express](https://github.com/jooaodanieel/devboost-backend)
